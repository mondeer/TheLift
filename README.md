# The Lift
This assignment was for CSC1024 (Computer Architecture). Using an Intel 8086 simulator we had to program a ready made lift peripheral to move up and down, output its status to a simulated VDU, to ensure it doesn't crash, and to move downwards immediately when enter is pressed on the virtual keypad.
